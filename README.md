# REVERTING TO A PREVIOUS COMMIT

In order to revert to a previous commit, we use the " git revert *commit address* " command.

You have to navigate in your github account to the commit stage you want to go back to.

After identifying it, you have to copy the commit address and in your terminal, write git revert plus that address and you will have went back to it.
